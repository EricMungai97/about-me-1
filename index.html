  <p>I have a bachelor degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Business Finance</p>
  <p>After college, I decided I wanted to go into real estate, so I went ahead and got my Real Estate license in 2009 and ultimately achieved to have my own real estate brokerage after a few years</p>
  <p>I later decided I wanted to learn and better understand the mortgage finance side of the industry so I then became a loan officer</p>
  <p>I want to learn as much as I can throughout this course and ultimately apply this knowledge to my current field and create a software that will contribute tremendously to the industry</p>
